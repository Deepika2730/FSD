         As a direct product of Aditya I know how my father toiled to place Aditya on the academic map of the country through its various phases of expansion even under the most trying circumstances.My Masters degree from UTS Australia, the best university in the continent, has given me deeper understanding and insight into the education system. This was coupled with the ideology of my father which enabled me to take the onus of steering Aditya. In succession, Aditya technical campus, Surampalem has been established to offer professional education in engineering, technology, management and pharmacy with the core concept of quality and excellence.Ever since its inception in 2001, the campus has registered speedy progress by upholding its abiding commitment to advance knowledge and educate students in science and technology. The prime aim of the campus is to make teaching and research relevant to the practical world.The campus offers numerous opportunities for the aspiring students which lay a strong foundation for the corporate world. T-Hub is a specimen of innumerable opportunities provided to students with enough competitive inputs to become T-shaped engineers, facilitate internship opportunities on the campus, develop partnerships with corporate and industry giants etc. through its various programs.<br><br>The ultimate aim of Aditya is to make the campus the ‘first stop’ for companies in the recruitment process. In this regard training and placement cell takes utmost care to groom students according to the needs of the industry.Keeping in view the demands of the work environment which is beyond just knowledge and marks, a lot of emphasis is laid on the overall personality development of the students. Various clubs run by the students, events like VEDA (technical fest) and COLOURS (youth fest) etc. challenge the latent talent in the students and bring them to the fore.Finally a desire can change nothing, a decision can change something but a determination can change everything. For sure Aditya is strongly determined to provide its students a successful careerWish you good luck.
