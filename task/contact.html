            I believe in the philosophy of thought, word and deed as eternal which made Aditya what it is today.

My thought to set a high bar to the institutions I setup by rising to the challenges of the educational field and get prepared for a life dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge,My word which always reflected my vision and gained the conviction of the heads of the institutes and parents,And my deed which makes my home and workplace as extensions of each other by considering the staff and students as the members of my extended family shaped Aditya.I know the value of a good education, more so because I did not have the benefit of the facilities that make the learning process smooth. I began my career as a lecturer, giving up my desire of qualifying in the Service Commission Examination. Out of my despair was born a strong determination which took the shape of Aditya Educational Institutions.<br><br>Challenges, Competition and the fear of failure are natural, but success embraces those who face these with the can-do attitude. For me this can-do attitude is backed up by our state-of the- art infrastructure, picturesque & inspiring setting and devoted team of faculty-members and administrators. The learning ambience at all the constituting Institutions is perfectly suited for all-round growth and academic excellence. Today, the group has a proud record of evolving efficient, confident and highly knowledgeable technocrats, managers, pharmacists and entrepreneurs with global thinking and futuristic mind-set.The present-day job market poses fresh challenges that need to be managed innovatively. Global business Incubation centre, Microsoft Innovation Centre, Technical Skill Development Institute, T-hub, Training and Placement Cell, GATE coaching etc., act as perfect vehicles for this.I wish you all the best.
