              The header element has an identical meaning to the site-wide banner landmark role, unless nested within sectioning content. Then, the header element is not a landmark.The header element can define a global site header, described as a banner in the accessibility tree. It usually includes a logo, company name, search feature, and possibly the global navigation or a slogan. It is generally located at the top of the page.Otherwise, it is a section in the accessibility tree, and usually contains the surrounding section's heading (an h1 â€“ h6 element) and optional subheading, but this is not required.
